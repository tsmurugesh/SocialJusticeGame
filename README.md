## Overview
The subject of this game is to explore and understand lesbianism, throught the point of view of a lesbian. While LGBTQ rights have definitely come a long way, there is a heavy stigma attached to identifying as a lesbian, so I’d like to highlight why it is not a bad thing, as well as explore the unique experience that lesbians have with gender, misogyny, and the self. 

This is a narrative driven story of the player character navigating through 3 stages of life, childhood, adolescence , and adulthood, realizing they are  a lesbian and navigating the different social and personal problems that come at every stage. Each stage of life will have 2 sub levels: navigating social situations and navigating personal introspection. The social situation part will have the player talk to various NPC’s (such as friends, classmates, etc.). The introspection will have the main character reflect on themselves and their identity. The User can switch to the mind room in the bedroom room of each stage of life.


## Technicals

The game is a series of state rooms the user can navigate through via a maze map or clicking buttons. The user controls a sprite that is drawn and can move around almost every room. In almost each room is also a few NPC's. If the user sprite collides with the NPCs the player gets a text bubble to use. Each of these NPC rooms is an extention of the base PNG room, which is just a room with a PNG background. In the bedroom of each phase, the user can click a clickable button that will chnage the state the the respective phases "mind room". Clicking the button in the respective mind room will move the player along to the next phase.
